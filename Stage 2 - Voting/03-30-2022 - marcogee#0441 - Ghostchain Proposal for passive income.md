What will the Boss DAO do?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Buy 50 cheapest Ghosts at floor price (aprox. 40k ada at the time of writing)


Why should the Boss DAO do this?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Holding Ghostchain NFTs produce a passive income from profits coming from the best upcoming marketplace on Cardano yet... FREEROAM.IO.

Also Ghostchain ghosties are a diamond handed project with only 166 out of 10k ghosties on the market (less than 2% at time of writing). This means they are scarce, rare and can be sold at a potential sky high price.  Many holders have seen the potential for Ghosts to pay for themselves.  Why sell a ghost when it will eventually pay for itself and continue earning passive income to the holder.  How many other NFT's can do that?

What is FreeRoam.IO?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
FreeRoam.IO is an upcoming marketplace set to launch any day.  While there are already plenty of NFT marketplaces (JPG, CNFT, etc) Freeroam aims to be much more.  A Cardano marketplace & hub. Not only will FreeRoam be a generalized CNFT marketplace, but it will also provide tools, analytics & more to enhance your CNFT experience. Currently the site will include advanced analytics and features not seen on other marketplaces.  Some examples include:

**Floor indicators** - FreeRoam will warn sellers when selling below the floor.  Ever seen someone forget to place a 0 at the end of a listing?  FreeRoam has your back.

**Dashboard Analytics**- As your NFT collection grows, it becomes harder and harder to manually value your wallet.  FreeRoam will allow you to link multiple wallets and give you an estimate of your wallet's worth.  Even better, it will try to estimate the true value of you NFT's, as we all know a top 1K Boss Cat is worth many times more than the floor BCRC price.  Even better, the dashboard will allow you to see information at a glance about your wallet value, similiar to Coinbase or other crypto tracking platforms.  For example you will be able to see what percentage that your wallet value is up or down.  Now you can easily show your friends how much money your silly JPG's are worth!  The Dashboard will also track the price of all those tokens in your wallet.

**Market Analytics**- Filter all Cardano NFTs by marketcap and other metrics.  Get at a glance information on top projects such as changes to the floor price, volume and more.

**Calendar**- Your one stop shop to find out what NFT projects have mints coming up.

**Categories**- For users that want to browse and look for something new, FreeRoam categorizes projects into different categories such as AI, Art, Games, Retro, Utility, etc.

**Advanced Loading**- Ever had issues with other marketplaces slowly loading NFTS?  FreeRoam's code allows for faster loading of even the largest NFT files.  Check this example of ClayNation and compare it to what happens when you try this on JPG. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/914169885754540042/955940569828446218/claynation.gif

**Soul Distribution**- A percentage of the Soul tokens will be distributed to users as a reward for trading on FreeRoam.  The more you use the site the more Soul you will receive!

Many more features are in the works that won't be disclosed ahead of time to keep a competative advantage.  Once users start using the site they will see the benefits of the site they will start to use FreeRoam as their home base which will increase the site's CNFT marketshare.

What does the Boss DAO stand to gain?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss DAO will benefit from the 50/10000 net profit shares or .5% (after maintenance costs) of the Freeroam Market place that will explode as Cardano Skyrockets and Freeroam matures. 

Boss DAO will also profit from the sick appreciation of hodling Ghosties.

Boss DAO will receive an airdrop of SOUL tokens based on the Ghostchain NFT's held.  SOUL token will be used throughout the Ghostchain and FreeRoam ecosystem. The utility of SOUL token will also be expanded as they progress through our roadmap. These tokens have the potential to become very valuble in the future.  Right now the developers are holding their true purpose close to their chest for competative advantage, but it is believed these may be used on FreeRoam or other projects that the team will work on after FreeRoam is up and running.  Owning Soul will allow you to vote on the future of FreeRoam.  By holding Soul the DAO will be able to propose and vote on ideas that may be beneficial to the DAO.

Profit estimation from Freeroam:
If Freeroam was JPG.STORE today, 50 ghosts would be giving the DAO around 3k per month ADA.  The DAO has a chance to share in the profits of a project that has the potential to constantly earn income that will eventually exceed the price that was paid for each NFT while still retaining the NFT asset.  As the CNFT space grows so will the value of the NFT and the passive income per ghost.  Imagine having a chance to own a piece of Opensea profits.  The CNFT space has huge room to grown.  The DAO has a chance to invest in something that could bring in a lot of future revenue for as long as NFT's are relevant into the treasury.  This will allow us to have a second source of revenue beyond the Boss DAO royalties.  FreeRoam does not need to take over the whole market to be successful.  Even with a modest marketshare, as the space grows so will the profit potential of holding ghosts.

*Cardano is still a baby and is just starting out, Imagine in a years time.


How will the treasury be involved?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Treasury will use a ~40k of allocated funds or any other amount that the DAO should deem necessary by Voting to purchase floor Ghostchain ghosties.



How long will the treasury funds be invested in the assets proposed?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ghostchain is a long term investment, Dao should hold for at least 3 years and then a vote should be held to assess if the Dao should continue to hold for another year and so on. 



When should the vote on this proposal be held?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASAP before Freeroam launches and price the spotlight will shine on them, causing the price to rise even further.
