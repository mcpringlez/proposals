## Proposal Summary
First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to read through this proposal. Simply, Boss DAO has an unprecendented opportunity to compound its passive income and gain market-wide influence over the CNFT market as a whole.


## Proposal Details

### What and How? 

The passing of this proposal will require all Boss DAO current and future treasury listings, as well as all future Boss DAO treasury sweeps and purchases exclusively on the Freeroam.io marketplace, with [caveats](#Cons?). This proposal also strongly encourages Boss DAO holders and surrounding community members to do the same as this will help to accelerate the [execution of our passive income strategy](#Strategy-and-Execution). 


### Cost? 

This will incur ZERO monetary cost to the DAO; only action & communication is necessary. 


### When?

This proposal should be brought to vote after Freeroam.io launches, of course! 


### Why?

1) Lower Fees - Boss DAO only pays 1.2% sales fees on Freeroam (due to the Boss DAO treasury holding a Legendary Ghostchain). Compare this to 2% on JPG.Store & 2.5% on CNFT.IO. As we grow as a DAO, it would be beneficial to min/max our margins.


2) Maximizing Passive ADA - Our investment in Ghostchain NFTs means the more sales volume on Freeroam, the higher the amount of quarterly ADA is deposited into the Boss DAO treasury.


3) Gain Influence by earning $SOUL Token. - BOSS DAO earns $SOUL token by Buying/Selling on Freeroam. $SOUL token is a deflationary token ([tokenomics can be found on this whitepaper](#Reference-Material)) that will be used to vote on proposals on the Freeroam marketplace. Why is this so powerful? Our high volume buying power as a DAO will quickly allow us to gain a hefty bag of $SOUL, thus gaining massive influence in steering the future of the Freeroam marketplace. Of course decisions will primarily be made to benefit Freeroam, but as an early adopter and future member of the Freeroam Senate, decisions can also be heavily influenced in Boss DAO’s favor as well. 


### Strategy and Execution

1) First Mover Advantage - We're new, but don’t underestimate the power of our DAO’s influence. We have powerful allies & members with large followings. We can leverage that. Being the first DAO to make a splash like this and making it public will stick in people's minds. Others that try follow suit on different marketplaces won't resonate as loudly because we were the first to act. We have an opportunity to make a bold, yet beneficial decision like this that will at first baffle other DAOs and individual investors, but then will make sense once they understand why.

2) We won't stand alone - Boss DAO won't be alone in exclusively using Freeroam. We only own 40 of the 10,000 Ghostchain NFTs out there. Which marketplace do you think the owners of the other 9960 Ghostchain NFTs are going to favor? Even without owning a Ghostchain NFT, when folks get used to earning the deflationary $SOUL token just by buying and selling on Freeroam, it won’t be long until people will regret spending their time or ADA on ANY other marketplace.

3) Psychological Snowball Effect -  Our bold statement combined with Freeroam's cutting edge innovations will play a factor in seller psychology and confidence during this stage. Folks who have their listings on other markets will start to wonder "What if I listed on Freeroam? Would this sell faster?" This curiosity will eventually entice sellers to move listings to Freeroam where they know certain buyers exclusively buy from. As more sellers catch on, FOMO will help snowball the movement and more folks will move their listings to Freeroam where WE ROAM. The cycle then FURTHER accelerates as we start approving proposals and start sweeping on the marketplace where we pledged to do so. By then we should have at least rattled some cages and brought over a good market share, securing some chunky passive ADA. 



### Cons?

#### Problem
One potential drawback to taking this approach would be missing out on lowest possible prices across ALL marketplaces during sweeps. This is one thing we noticed during some of our early sweeps on JPG.Store. We swept on JPG.store but CNFT.Io had lower prices after a few purchases and we missed out on 5-10% savings here and there.

#### Solutions
Even though this situation will be somewhat undesirable at first, we can come up with solutions to mitigate this. For example, one mitigation could potentialy be to  covertly and/or strategically pause or "stagger" our sweeps in an unpredictable manner. This will provide 2 favorable market reactions: 

1) Pausing after a partial surge in purchases will give outside sellers an opportunity to see where the liquidity is and move their listings over from other markets to Freeroam, which will keep our average entry price low.

2) Transparency is a double edged sword. Letting all holders know when a vote is passed is noble, but a minority will still look to take advantage. Covert staggering and misdirection will discourage opportunists who plan to list lower than floor to "sell into the sweep". If sellers can't time when the DAO is spending that proposal's budget, they'll be discouraged to plan or time the sweep, and the price will behave more organically as it did before any proposal was approved.

3) If the two solutions above still don't produce favorable market results, this proposal authorizes Boss DAO leadership to make a judgement call to purchase the assets on a different marketplace once they meet or exceed a threshold of a 15% discount from Freeroam floor.


### Conclusion:

A lot of individual investors and DAOs (including us) invest in the future potential of individual NFT projects. What's unique about this proposal is it's less about an individual project and more about leveraging our influence as a DAO in altering the direction CNFT market as a whole. Maximizing our passive income to the treasury is an added benefit. By voting YES for this proposal, not only will we choose accelerate our DAO’s growth, but we can gain a solid grasp on the future of this space. Similar to BCRC's huge impact on CNFTs, other DAOs will soon be quietly kicking themselves (but probably publicly FUD & discredit us) when our project-neutral “market-focused” strategy was right in front of everyone but WE were the first to take action. 

Buckle up, be proactive, & be resilient.
