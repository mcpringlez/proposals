## Proposal Summary
Boss DAO has an opportunity to compound passive income and gain CNFT market-wide influence through Freeroam.


## Proposal Details

### How? 

By concentrating ALL of our DAO’s sales and purchases onto Freeroam.io.


### When?

After Freeroam launches, of course!


### Why?

1) Lower Fees - Boss DAO only pays 1.2% sales fees on Freeroam (due to the Boss DAO treasury holding a Legendary Ghostchain). Compare this to 2% on JPG.Store & 2.5% on CNFT.IO. As we grow as a DAO, it would be beneficial to min/max our margins.


2) Maximizing Passive ADA - Our investment in Ghostchain NFTs means the more sales volume on Freeroam, the higher the amount of quarterly ADA is deposited into the Boss DAO treasury.


3) Earn $SOUL Token. Gain Influence. - BOSS DAO earns $SOUL token by Buying/Selling on Freeroam. SOUL token is a deflationary token that will be used to vote on proposals on the Freeroam marketplace. Why is this so powerful? Our collective buying power as a DAO will quickly allow us to gain massive influence in steering the future of the Freeroam marketplace. Of course decisions will primarily be made to benefit Freeroam, but as an early adopter and member of the Freeroam Senate, decisions can also be heavily influenced in Boss DAO’s favor as well.


4) Snowball Effect of Liquidity. - Being the first DAO to make a decision like this and making it public to our partners and community members will eventually pressure sellers to move listings to where we and our partners will buy. Don’t underestimate the power of our DAO’s influence. People looking to maximize their liquidity won’t risk missing out and will move their listings to Freeroam where WE ROAM. As our actions and sweeps follow our announcement, more and more people will be pressured to move their listings to Freeroam and the market share will shift in our favor.


### Cons?

1) One potential drawback to taking this approach would be missing out on lowest possible prices across ALL marketplaces during sweeps. This is one thing we noticed during some of our early sweeps on JPG.Store. We swept on JPG.store but CNFT.Io had lower prices after a few purchases and we missed out on 5-10% savings on a couple purchases.

2) Even though the short term effect of this situation is somewhat undesirable, think about the loud message we’ll be sending to sellers over the long term. Boss DAO is not alone in this. We only own 40 of the 10,000 Ghostchain NFTs out there. Which marketplace do you think the owners of the other 9960 Ghostchain NFTs are going to list? Even without owning a Ghostchain NFT, when folks get used to earning the deflationary $SOUL token just by buying and selling on Freeroam, it won’t be long until people will regret spending their time or ADA on ANY other marketplace.


### Conclusion:

A lot of individual investors and DAOs (including us) invest in the future potential of individual NFT projects. This proposal isn’t about one project, more so about leveraging our influence as a DAO in altering the CNFT market as a whole while maximizing our passive income going to the treasury. By voting YES for this proposal, not only will we choose accelerate our DAO’s growth, but we can gain a solid foothold in influencing the CNFT market as a whole. This “market-based” approach is a strategy every DAO will soon wish they adopted first.
