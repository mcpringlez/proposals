## Proposal Summary
First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to read through this proposal. Simply, Boss DAO has an unprecendented opportunity to compound its passive income and gain market-wide influence over the Cardano NFT market as a whole.


## Proposal Details

### What and How? 

The passing of this proposal will require all Boss DAO current and future treasury listings, as well as all future Boss DAO treasury sweeps and purchases to happen exclusively on the Freeroam.io marketplace. This proposal outlines the [risks, mitigations, and exception thresholds](#Cons) that come with this exclusivity. This proposal also strongly encourages Boss DAO holders and surrounding community members to do the same as this will help to accelerate the [execution of our passive income strategy](#Strategy-and-Execution). 


### Cost? 

This will incur ZERO monetary cost to the DAO; only action & communication are necessary. 


### When?

This proposal should be brought to vote after Freeroam.io launches, of course! 


### Why?

1) Lower Fees - Boss DAO only pays 1.2% sales fees on Freeroam (due to the Boss DAO treasury holding a Legendary Ghostchain). Compare this to 2% on JPG.Store & 2.5% on CNFT.IO. As we grow as a DAO, it would be beneficial to min/max our margins.


2) Maximizing Passive ADA - Our investment in Ghostchain NFTs means the more sales volume on Freeroam, the higher the amount of quarterly ADA is deposited into the Boss DAO treasury.


3) Gain Influence by earning $SOUL Token. - BOSS DAO earns $SOUL token by Buying/Selling on Freeroam. $SOUL token is a deflationary token ([tokenomics can be found on this whitepaper](#Reference-Material)) that will be used to vote on proposals on the Freeroam marketplace. Why is this so powerful? Our high volume buying power as a DAO will quickly allow us to gain a hefty bag of $SOUL, thus gaining massive influence in steering the future of the Freeroam marketplace. Of course decisions using $SOUL will primarily be made to benefit Freeroam, but as an early adopter and future member of the Freeroam Senate, decisions can be orchestrated to be mutually beneficial to Boss DAO as well. 


### Strategy and Execution

1) First Mover Advantage - We're new, but don’t underestimate the power of our DAO’s influence. We have powerful allies & members with large followings. We can leverage that. Being the first DAO to make a splash like this and making it public will resonate accross the Cardano NFT space. Others that try to follow suit on different marketplaces won't resonate as loudly because we were the first to act. We have an opportunity to make a bold, yet beneficial decision like this that will at first baffle other DAOs and individual investors in the space, but then will make sense once they understand why.

2) We won't stand alone - Boss DAO won't be alone in exclusively using Freeroam. We only own 40 of the 10,000 Ghostchain NFTs out there. Which marketplace do you think the owners of the other 9960 Ghostchain NFTs are going to favor? Even without owning a Ghostchain NFT, when folks get used to earning the deflationary $SOUL token just by buying and selling on Freeroam, it won’t be long until people will regret spending their time or ADA on ANY other marketplace.

3) Psychological Snowball Effect -  Our bold statement combined with Freeroam's cutting edge innovations will play a factor in seller psychology and confidence during the marketplace market share transition stage. Folks who have their listings on other markets will start to wonder "What if I listed on Freeroam? Would this sell faster?" This curiosity will eventually entice sellers to move listings to Freeroam where they know certain buyers exclusively buy from. As more sellers catch on, FOMO will help snowball the movement and more folks will move their listings to Freeroam where WE ROAM. The cycle then FURTHER accelerates as we start approving proposals and start sweeping on the marketplace where we pledged to do so. By this time we will have at least rattled some cages and brought over a good market share, securing a good chunk of passive ADA. 



### Cons

#### Risks
One risk of taking this approach would be missing out on lowest possible prices across ALL marketplaces during sweeps. This is one thing we noticed during some of our early sweeps on JPG.Store. We swept on JPG.store but CNFT.Io had lower prices after a few purchases and we missed out on 5-10% savings here and there.

#### Mitigations
Even though this situation will be somewhat undesirable at first, we can come up with solutions to mitigate this. For example, one mitigation could potentialy be to  covertly and/or strategically pause or "stagger" our sweeps in an unpredictable manner. This will provide 2 favorable market reactions: 

1) Pausing after a partial surge in purchases will give outside sellers an opportunity to see where the liquidity is and move their listings over from other markets to Freeroam, which will keep our average entry price low.

2) Transparency is a double edged sword. Letting all holders know when a vote is passed is noble, but a minority of holders will still look to take advantage. Erratic staggering of purchases and covert misdirection will discourage opportunistic insiders who plan to list lower than floor to "sell into the sweep", which hurts that project's organic price momentum. If opportunistic insiders can't properly time when the DAO is spending that proposal's budget, they'll probably get wrecked. The overarching effect will be the price will behave more organically as it did before any proposal was approved, as inside opportunists will be hesitant to try to time the sweep, assuming they were even given the right info before action was taken.

#### Exception Threshold
If this problem arises and we've exausted all strategies (pausing, staggering, etc) during the purchase of a specific asset, this proposal authorizes Boss DAO treasury to purchase the assets on a different marketplace once they meet or exceed a threshold of a 20% discount from Freeroam floor. This threshold can be amended via future proposals if we find that it proves to be too large or small.


### Conclusion:

A lot of individual investors and DAOs (including us) invest in the future potential of individual NFT projects. What's unique about this proposal is it's less about an individual project and more about leveraging our influence as a DAO in influencing the direction of the Cardano NFT market as a whole, a macro play. Maximizing our passive income to the treasury is an added benefit. 

By voting YES for this proposal, not only will we choose to accelerate our DAO’s monetary growth, but we make a power play for increased influence over the future of the Cardano NFT space. Similar to BCRC's quick ascension in the Cardano NFT space, the successful execution of this project-neutral & macro-focused strategy will send shockwaves through the Cardano NFT space. Other DAOs will soon be kicking themselves for not thinking of it first (brace yourself for jealousy FUD) when our bold strategy finds success.

Buckle up, be proactive, & be resilient. Be the BOSS.
