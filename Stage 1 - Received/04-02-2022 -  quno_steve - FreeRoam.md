## Proposal Summary
Boss DAO has an opportunity to compound passive income and gain CNFT market-wide influence.


## Proposal Details

### How? 

By concentrating ALL of our DAO’s sales and purchases onto Freeroam.io.


### When?

After Freeroam launches, of course!


### Why?

1) Lower Fees - Boss DAO only pays 1.2% sales fees on Freeroam (due to the Boss DAO treasury holding a Legendary Ghostchain). Compare this to 2% on JPG.Store & 2.5% on CNFT.IO. As we grow as a DAO, it would be beneficial to min/max our margins.


2) Maximizing Passive ADA - Our investment in Ghostchain NFTs means the more sales volume on Freeroam, the higher the amount of quarterly ADA is deposited into the Boss DAO treasury.


3) Earn $SOUL Token. Gain Influence. - BOSS DAO earns $SOUL token by Buying/Selling on Freeroam. SOUL token is a deflationary token that will be used to vote on proposals on the Freeroam marketplace. Why is this so powerful? Our collective buying power as a DAO will quickly allow us to gain massive influence in steering the future of the Freeroam marketplace. Of course decisions will primarily be made to benefit Freeroam, but as an early adopter and member of the Freeroam Senate, decisions can also be heavily influenced in Boss DAO’s favor as well.


### Strategy and Execution

1) First Mover Advantage - We're new, but don’t underestimate the power of our DAO’s influence. We have powerful allies & members with large followings. We can leverage that. Being the first DAO to make a splash like this and making it public will stick in people's minds. Others that try follow suit on different marketplaces won't resonate as loudly because we were the first to act. We have an opportunity to make a bold, yet beneficial decision like this that will at first baffle other DAOs and individual investors, but then will make sense once they understand why.

2)  We're not alone - Boss DAO won't be alone in exclusively using Freeroam. We only own 40 of the 10,000 Ghostchain NFTs out there. Which marketplace do you think the owners of the other 9960 Ghostchain NFTs are going to favor? Even without owning a Ghostchain NFT, when folks get used to earning the deflationary $SOUL token just by buying and selling on Freeroam, it won’t be long until people will regret spending their time or ADA on ANY other marketplace.

3)  Psychological Snowball Effect -  Our bold statement combined with Freeroam's cutting edge innovations will play a factor in seller psychology and confidence during this stage. Folks who have their listings on other markets will start to wonder "What if I listed on Freeroam? Would this sell faster?" This curiosity will eventually entice sellers to move listings to marketplaces (like Freeroam) where they know certain buyers exclusively buy from. As more people catch on, FOMO will help snowball the movement and more folks will move their listings to Freeroam where WE ROAM. The cycle then FURTHER accelerates as we start approving proposals and start sweeping where we said we would. By then we should have at least rattled some cages and brought over a good market share, securing some chunky passive income.



### Cons?

1) One potential drawback to taking this approach would be missing out on lowest possible prices across ALL marketplaces during sweeps. This is one thing we noticed during some of our early sweeps on JPG.Store. We swept on JPG.store but CNFT.Io had lower prices after a few purchases and we missed out on 5-10% savings here and there.

2) Even though this situation is undesirable, we can mitigate by temporarily pausing our sweeps to allow the sellers time to move over from other markets or allow paperhands to list lower than floor after an abrupt rise, which will lower our average entry price. 


### Conclusion:

A lot of individual investors and DAOs (including us) invest in the future potential of individual NFT projects. This proposal isn’t about one project, more so about leveraging our influence as a DAO in altering the CNFT market as a whole while maximizing our passive income going to the treasury. By voting YES for this proposal, not only will we choose accelerate our DAO’s growth, but we can gain a solid foothold in influencing the CNFT market as a whole. This “market-based” approach is a strategy every DAO will soon wish they adopted first.
